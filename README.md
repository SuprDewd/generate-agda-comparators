# Generate Agda Comparators

This is a tiny Haskell "library" for generating comparators (equality and less
than) for Agda data types.

`Main.hs` contains an example for Agda's `Term` and [associated
types](http://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/reflection.html). The
generated output (along with two helper functions) can be found in
`TermCmp.agda`.
